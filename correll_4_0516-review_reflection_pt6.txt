	Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Casting is the process of taking a variable with a certain type and turning it in to a different variable with a different type. Up-casting is taking a variable with a specific type and turning it in to a variable with a more generic type. Down-casting is taking a variable with a generic type and turning it in to a variable with a more specific type.
	Give a specific code example for up-casting.
int animal = 5;
float cat;
cat = animal;
	Give a specific code example for down-casting.
(with previous)
animal = (int)cat;

char pear = '^';
String apple = "" + ^;
