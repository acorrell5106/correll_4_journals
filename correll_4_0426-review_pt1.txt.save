	Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number:
int cubed() {
            answer = number * number * number;
            return answer;
            
        }
	Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number:
int cubed() {
            answer = number * number * number;
            return answer;
            
        }
	Create the class, a class constructor, and an object for class Student:
public class Student {
	public int grades;
	public String classes;
	public boolean tardy;
}

Student(int a, String b) {
	this.grades = a;
	this.classes = b;
	this.tardy = true;
}

public Student michael;

michael = new Student(90, Physics);
	Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?
If we were to continue with our Arduino project, we would aim to create a tuner with multiple octives instead of one, and possibly have the piezo detect noises and determine their frequency.
