	Explain the biggest problem solving challenge you solved.
I believe that the biggest problem solving challenge I solved was completing year 20, where you had to multiply the numbers. Trying to get the two numbers to multiply when their was no multiple command was rather difficult.
        Explain the rationale behind the last problem you solved.
For year 20, to multiply the numbers I had to add the same number multiple times until it resembled the two numbers multiplied. I did this by first grabbing a number from the inbox, and copying them to both slot 0 and 1. After that I grab the next number, and then copy that to slot 5 (the space under 0), and if the second number is zero, then I just take the number to the outbox. After that, I subtract from the second number, and add slot 1 with slot 2, copying the sum back to slot 1. I continue this until the number in slot 5 (the second number) becomes zero, and I then copy the number from slot 1 (which should now be the product) and put it in the outbox. I then start the program all over again until there are no more numbers in the inbox.
