	What is assembly?
Assembly, or asm, is a low-level programming lanaguage where there is a strong relationship between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.
	What is it good for?
Assembly is good when you want to create something that is very quick, and and program maintenance is easier.
	How is assembly different than Java?
Assembly is not very abstract, and Java is abstract.
	What are differences between high level and low level languages?
While high level languages are very abstract, low level has little to no abstraction.
	Which type is Java? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of that language type?
Java is a high-level language because there is a lot of abstraction between the language and the machine language.
	Which type is assembly? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of that language type?
Assembly is a low-level language because there is a little to no abstraction difference between the language and machine language, and is close to the hardware.
